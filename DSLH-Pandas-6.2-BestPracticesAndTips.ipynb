                "   - Take advantage of vectorized operations in Pandas, which are optimized and faster than traditional loops.\n",
                "   - Avoid iterating over rows or columns whenever possible.\n",
                "\n",
                "2. **Use `apply()` judiciously:**\n",
                "   - While `apply()` can be powerful, it can also be slow. Try to use built-in Pandas functions before resorting to `apply()`.\n",
                "\n",
                "3. **Select Columns Wisely:**\n",
                "   - Only select the columns you need for your analysis. Avoid unnecessary column selections.\n",

                "   - Be mindful of memory usage, especially for large datasets. \n",

                "\n",
                "1. **Memory Management:**\n",
                "   - Use `dtype` parameter: Specify appropriate data types for columns using the `dtype` parameter when reading data with `read_csv()` or other read functions.\n",
                "   - Downcast numeric types: Use `astype()` to downcast numeric types to lower-memory alternatives.\n",
                "\n",
                "2. **Chunked Reading:**\n",
                "   - Read data in chunks: Instead of reading the entire dataset at once, use the `chunksize` parameter in `read_csv()` to read data in smaller chunks.\n",
                "   - Process chunks sequentially: Perform operations on each chunk and aggregate the results. This is useful for operations where the entire dataset is not needed simultaneously.\n",
                "\n",
                "3. **Parallel Processing:**\n",
                "   - Leverage multi-core processing: Use the `modin` library, which provides a Pandas API with enhanced parallel processing capabilities.\n",
                "   - Consider Dask: Dask is a parallel computing library that integrates seamlessly with Pandas and can handle larger-than-memory computations.\n",
                "\n",
                "4. **Optimize GroupBy Operations:**\n",
                "   - Be cautious with large GroupBy operations: Grouping a large dataset can be memory-intensive. Use `agg` with a dictionary to specify different aggregation functions for different columns.\n",
                "   - Use `dask.dataframe.groupby`: If using Dask, leverage its distributed computing capabilities for GroupBy operations.\n",
                "\n",
                "5. **Use Sparse Data Structures:**\n",
                "   - For datasets with a significant number of missing values, consider using Pandas' sparse data structures (e.g., `SparseDataFrame`).\n",
                "\n",
                "6. **Reduce Memory Footprint:**\n",
                "   - Drop unnecessary columns: Remove columns that are not required for your analysis to reduce the memory footprint.\n",
                "   - Handle categorical data: Convert categorical columns to the `category` type to save memory.\n",
                "\n",

                "9. **Optimize Filtering and Selection:**\n",
                "   - Optimize boolean indexing: Use efficient boolean indexing techniques to filter data without creating unnecessary copies.\n",
                "\n",
                "10. **Avoid Unnecessary Operations:**\n",
                "    - Be selective in your operations: Only perform operations that are necessary for your analysis. Avoid unnecessary calculations.\n",
                "\n",
