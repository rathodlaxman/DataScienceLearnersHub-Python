                "\n",
                "1. **No Compilation**: In interpreted languages, you don't need a separate compilation step to generate machine code or executable files. Instead, the interpreter reads the source code line by line and executes it immediately.\n",
                "    \n",
                "2. **Human-Readable**: Interpreted languages typically use human-readable syntax, which makes them easier for programmers to write and understand. This is because the code is executed in a format that closely resembles the source code.\n",
                "    \n",
                "3. **Portability**: Code written in an interpreted language is generally more portable since it relies on the presence of an interpreter rather than specific machine code. This means that code can often be run on different platforms with minimal modification.\n",
                "    \n",
                "4. **Slower Execution**: Interpreted languages can be slower than compiled languages because the interpreter must read and execute the code in real-time. This can result in a performance overhead, especially for computationally intensive tasks.\n",
                "    \n",
                "5. **Dynamic Typing**: Many interpreted languages use dynamic typing, where variable types are determined at runtime rather than being explicitly declared. This can make code more flexible but may also lead to runtime errors if not used carefully.\n",
