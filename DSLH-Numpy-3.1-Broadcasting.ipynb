                "1. **Dimensions Compatibility:**\n",
                "   - Two dimensions are compatible when they are equal or one of them is 1.\n",
                "   - For example, a 3x5 array can be broadcasted with a 1x5 array, as their dimensions are compatible.\n",

                "2. **Size Compatibility:**\n",
                "   - Arrays with smaller dimensions are padded with ones on their left side until their shapes match.\n",
                "   - For example, a 3x1 array can be broadcasted with a 3x5 array by duplicating its column along the new axis.\n",

                "3. **Arrays with the Same Number of Dimensions:**\n",
                "   - If two arrays have the same number of dimensions, their shapes must be compatible along each dimension.\n",
                "   - For example, a 3x5 array can be broadcasted with another 3x5 array.\n",
                "\n",
                "4. **Broadcasting Along Multiple Dimensions:**\n",
                "   - Broadcasting extends to multiple dimensions simultaneously, but it must follow the rules for each dimension.\n",
                "   - For example, a 3x1x5 array can be broadcasted with a 1x4x1 array.\n",
                "\n",
                "5. **Size of 1 Dimensions:**\n",
                "   - Any dimension with size 1 is considered to be effectively stretched or repeated.\n",
                "   - For example, a 3x1 array can be broadcasted with a 1x5 array.\n",
                "\n",
